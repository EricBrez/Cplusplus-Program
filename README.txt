This project is an investment calculator. It allows a user to input the initial deposit amount, a length of the investment, their interest rate and any monthly contributions they would make to the investment and returns the amount of interest and their final amount for every year that the term is invested.  I believe I did the calculations well as well as input validation. I believe that the code is readable even if there hadn't been any comments which is something I strive for when I create a project though understandably comments are always appreciated. The project required that I display tables both with and without monthly contributions but I believe it could have been more user friendly if I had input a menu where the user could choose to view one, the other, or both or quit before taking any input. I believe giving the user that option rather than forcing them through one iteration before being able to quit or forcing them to view both tables if they only wanted to see one could have benefits for the user, The most challenging part of the code, I think was the code to display the tables specifically the formatting. I had to resort to my textbook for help with the spacing and filling functions but it was a good time to practice them in a realistic situation. I thought I was being clever by creating a layered for loop to make the calculations the outer one iterating on each year of the investment and printing the end of year numbers numbers and the inner loop calculating each month to ensure that the numbers were correct. All in all I enjoyed writing this program (and it came at a coincidental time in my life as I am working on learning more about finances).
